#### what is the single window concept?

A Single Window (SW) is defined by UNECE (UN/CEFACT) and WCO (World Customs Organization) as a facility that allows parties involved in trade and transport to lodge standardized information and documents with a single entry point to fulfill all import, export, and transit-related regulatory requirements. In a Single Window the individual data elements should only be submitted once.

Also, you can find Single Window data harmonization guidelines for developers on WCO's [website][wco].
> WCO has developed Single Window Data Harmonization Guidelines to provide Single Window environment developers with tools that can be used in order to achieve data harmonization and to develop internationally standardized data sets including the data element names, definitions, the United Nations Trade Data Element Directory (UNTDED) tag and the formats.
